# Security Architecture Traceability Register

The Traceability Register provides a consolidated view linking:

Risk → Decision → Control → Owner → Validation → Review Status

It serves as the governance control layer ensuring that:

- Every implemented control maps to a documented decision  
- Every decision maps to an identified risk  
- Ownership is clearly defined  
- Validation expectations are visible  
- Review cadence is enforced  

This register enables architectural defensibility, audit readiness, and control lifecycle visibility.

All approved Security Architecture Decisions (SAD-###) must be recorded here.
