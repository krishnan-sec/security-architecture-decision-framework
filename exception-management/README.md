# Exception Management

This folder defines the structured process for managing time-bound security exceptions.

Exceptions are used when a security control cannot be fully implemented due to technical, operational, or business constraints.

All exceptions must:

- Be formally documented
- Reference a related Decision ID (SAD-###)
- Include a defined expiry date
- Identify compensating controls
- Be approved by an appropriate authority
- Be tracked in the Traceability Register

Exceptions are not permanent design choices.  
They are controlled deviations subject to review and expiry.
